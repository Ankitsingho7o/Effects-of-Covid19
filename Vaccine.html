      <p>
        A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired
        immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically
        contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is
        often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or
        one of its surface proteins.

      <h1 class="h-primary">Why is Vaccination Important?</h1>
      <p>
        Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent disease and save
        lives â€“ now more than ever. Today there are vaccines available to
        protect against at least 20 diseases, such as diphtheria, tetanus,
        pertussis, influenza and measles. Together, these vaccines save the
        lives of up to 3 million people every year.

    <section id="safety">
      <h1 class="h-primary">Are Vaccine Safe?</h1>
      <p>
        Vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are usually minor
        and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side
        effects are possible, but extremely rare.
        <br />
        Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of
        trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it
        is introduced. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information
        from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.
